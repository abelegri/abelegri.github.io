        <p>
          As part of ThinkChicago in Fall 2018, Alexa participated in a civic tech challenge in order to solve civic problems in the Chicago area. Her chosen topic was education, and the specific problem was lack of student involvement in after school programs. After discussion with past Chicago Public School (CPS) students the team created a <a href="http://alexabelegrin.me/CPSconnect.pdf" target="_blank">proposal for CPS Connect</a>, a website that allows students to view all of the local events in one place. Additionally, this website will connect parents with their children's schedules which is particularly useful for working parents with more than one child. Further, the students and parents will be able to sort events by students' interests, age levels, and locations to find events that are appropriate for the individual student.

          Alexa and her sister, Vic, learned about social entrepreneurship through the learn-by-doing curriculum provided by Acumen+. In this course, Alexa helped Vic define and scope a problem she was having as a social servant. The course lead them through combining passions and skills to solve social problems using techniques such as Theory of Change, Ecosystem Mapping, and Scaling which were <a href="http://alexabelegrin.me/ClientInfoShare.pdf" target="_blank">documented and presented</a> at the end of the course. While Alexa and Vic did not create a prototype in this course, they are planning on continuing research in the ecosystem and begin prototyping static GUIs.

          During her junior year, Alexa participated in Purdue's first annual 3 Day Startup program. This program introduced her to entrepreneurship and gave her expereience with rapid prototyping, need finding, and customer discovery. She and a team of four other students noticed a gap in the running app market. They interviewed customers at running stores and students at Purdue University's fitness facilities to gather more data, which was then coded to determine customer needs. They created a wireframe and mock up of a running app that would allow runners to get more variations in their running routes while remaining safe. At the end of this weekend event, Alexa and her team <a href="http://alexabelegrin.me/PrefectRun.pdf" target="_blank">presented their design and business model</a> to a panel of investors and all other student participants.
