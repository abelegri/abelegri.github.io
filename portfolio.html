        <p>
          As part of ThinkChicago in Fall 2018, Alexa participated in a civic tech challenge in order to solve civic problems in the Chicago area. Her chosen topic was education, and the specific problem was lack of student involvement in after school programs. After discussion with past Chicago Public School (CPS) students the team came up with CPS Connect, a website that allows students to view all of the local events in one place. Additionally, this website will connect parents with their children's schedules which is particularly useful for working parents with more than one child. Further, the students and parents will be able to sort events by students' interests, age levels, and locations to find events that are appropriate for the individual student.

        <p>
          Alexa and her sister, Vic, learned about social entrepreneurship through the learn-by-doing curriculum provided by Acumen+. In this course, Alexa helped Vic define and scope a problem she was having as a social servant. The course lead them through combining passions and skills to solve social problems using techniques such as Theory of Change, Ecosystem Mapping, and Scaling. While Alexa and Vic did not create a prototype in this course, they are planning on continuing research in the ecosystem and begin prototyping static GUIs.
